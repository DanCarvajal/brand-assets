## How to Use

The Tax Foundation logo is a complex design that looks best in large sizes. The logo is typically either a TF Blue (#0094FF) fill, or white on a TF Blue background. Using an SVG copy of the logo is always preferable because it scales to any size without quality loss, but a collection of PNG files in various sizes are also included in `brand-assets/generated-assets` for quick use.

For special cases when a very small digital instance of the logo is required, the Small and Small Horizontal versions of the logo are available. These versions of the logo have been simplified and redrawn to render well at small scale on screens.
